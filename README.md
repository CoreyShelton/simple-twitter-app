# simple-twitter-app

This is a very basic starter twitter app

### Steps
1. Besure that the PHP script is running on some type of server
2. Go to https://apps.twitter.com/ and create a new app
2. Be sure to create and copy the: *Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token, Access Token Secret*
3. You'll need to copy these bits of code and paste them into the appropriate places in the ```twitter.php``` file
4. Once you've add the *Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token, Access Token Secret* to the twitter.php file and you've specified the twitter users name that you want to get, you should see the output in the ```index.html``` file
